# Tern - A lightweight database schema migration utility for postgres

### Backstory

I am working on a FastAPI project that is using a postgres database, and I am not a great fan of ORM to write database tables(skill issue), I want to do it in pure SQL, so I chose `alembic` which is a great tool and was writing the sql for db tables but in .py extension enclosed in the strings, which again I didn't liked it(again skill issue), so like every self proclaimed cracked engineer I thought of to build my very own migration utility which will make me looked cracked.

### Why did I chose the name `Tern`?

The name is taken from the bird `Arctic Tern` - Known for its long-distance migration, traveling up to 71,000 km or 44,000 miles in a year, from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back.

### Why did I chose rust?

I am a wannabe rustacean, so I have to write in rust.

### Why did I chose postgres?

Because this is the only database that I know.

### Why you should choose it?

Because It is written in rust. What other reason do you want, everything else is a skill issue.
