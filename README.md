# 🐦 Tern — A Lightweight Database Schema Migration Utility for Postgres

## ✨ What is Tern?

Tern is a lightweight, **SQL-first** database migration tool built for **PostgreSQL**, designed with simplicity and speed in mind — no ORMs, no boilerplate, no nonsense.

You write raw SQL. Tern makes it fly. 🕊️

## 📜 Backstory

I’m working on a FastAPI project with a Postgres database. Now listen...

- I'm **not a fan of ORMs** for making database tables — maybe a skill issue.
- I gave `alembic` a shot (great tool), but writing SQL in Python strings? Yeah nah.

So, like every wannabe Linus Torvalds, I decided to write my own migration tool.

Enter **Tern**.

## 🐧 Why the Name?

Named after the **Arctic Tern** — a bird that migrates up to **71,000 km per year**, from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back.

Just googled migratory bird name and found this one.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Because I’m a wannabe rustacean 🦀, and like every rustacean, only one language has my heart, rust.

## 🐘 Why Postgres?

Because it’s the only database I know.  
And because it's awesome.

## 🤔 Why Should _You_ Use It?

Because it’s written in **Rust**. That’s the only reason you need. Everything else? Skill issue.

## 🚀 Installation

### 🐧 Linux

```bash
wget https://github.com/Thakur127/tern/releases/download/v0.2.1/tern-v0.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

tar -xvf tern-v0.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

mv tern-v0.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/* ~/.local/bin

rm -rf tern-v0.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz tern-v0.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

**Add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable**

```sh
vim ~/.bashrc
```

Add following line in the file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Save and exit, use command `ESC -> :wq -> Enter`

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bashrc` to make the changes take effect.

**Check**

```sh
tern --version
```

### 🪟 Windows (probably)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Thakur127/tern/releases) section.
2. Download the latest binary for your system.
3. Extract it and move `tern.exe` to:  
   `C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Local\Programs\tern\tern.exe`
4. Add that path to your `PATH` environment variable.

> I haven’t tested this — the steps were generated by an AI. Good luck 🤞

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Thakur127/tern.git`
2. Navigate to the root of the repository: `cd tern`
3. Build the binary: `cargo build --release`
4. Move the binary to: `~/.local/bin/tern`
5. Add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable
6. Check the version: `tern --version`

## 🧪 Usage

```sh
tern --help
```

For full CLI usage, see: [docs/cli.md](./docs/cli.md)

## 📎 TL;DR

**Tern** is for people who:

- Hate writing SQL in strings
- Want to use plain `.sql` files
- Love Rust (or pretend to)
- Use Postgres (and only Postgres)
- Don’t want a full-blown migration framework

## 🧠 Pro Tip

Make Tern your own. Use it however cracked you want. Just remember:

> If it breaks, it’s a skill issue.
